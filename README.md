-   development, smoke testing, deployment
-   in situe testing, performance and improvements

## Project Goals

## User Stories

User story: As a First‑Time Visitor, I want a concise, clear, layout with consistent and familiar styling, so I can find weather information quickly and efficiently,

User story: As a Visitor looking for information, I need easy navigation and a user‑friendly design, including a responsive layout for my device, so I can access information on mobile.

User story: As a Regular User, I would like customisability, and the ability to save my favourite locations, so I can personalise my experience.

User story: As a Site Owner, I want the site to follow accessibility best practices and responsive design, so everyone can access information.

User story: As a Site Owner, I want the site to follow development best practices, so it is secure and easy to maintain to minimize downtime.

## Solution Design Details

## Testing

## Deployment and workflow

This project is deployed through github pages and follows a simplified agile gitflow methodology:

-   Each day of the project being considered one 'sprint'.
-   Main branch is preserved as the deployed and live branch, whilst all development work will be conducted on feature branches.
-   Code deployments to the live project environment will only available through a pull request to main. This enables a CI/CD approach.
-   All feautures must be tested on the 'develop' branch before being considered a release candidate to main.
    This ensures the deployed project maintains a stable codebase, and provides a scaleable workflow should the project scope increase and more developers were required to join the project.

## Use of AI in development and project retrospective.

Ai used to create initial boilerplate from wireframe, streamlining bootstrap structuring. Due to fairly complex wireframe, this did have superfluous css classes that needed removed.
